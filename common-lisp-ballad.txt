    A SHORT BALLAD DEDICATED TO THE GROWTH OF PROGRAMS
	==================================================
			by
		  Ashwin Ram

	This is a tale of a sorry quest
	To master pure code at the T guru's behest
	I enrolled in a class that appealing did seem
	For it promised to teach fine things like T3 and Scheme

	The first day went fine; we learned of cells
	And symbols and lists and functions as well
	Lisp I had mastered and excited was I
	For to master T3 my hackstincts did cry

	I sailed through the first week with no problems at all
	And I even said "closure" instead of "function call"
	Then said the master that ready were we
	To start real hacking instead of simple theory

	Will you, said he, write me a function please
	That in lists would associate values with keys
	I went home and turned on my trusty Apollo
	And wrote a function whose definition follows:

	(cdr (assq key a-list))

	A one-liner I thought, fool that I was
	Just two simple calls without a COND clause
	But when I tried this function to run
	CDR didn't think that NIL was much fun

	So I tried again like the good King of yore
	And of code I easily generated some more:

	(cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr))

	It got longer but purer, and it wasn't too bad
	But then COND ran out and that was quite sad

	Well, that isn't hard to fix, I was told
	Just write some more code, my son, be bold
	Being young, not even a moment did I pause
	I stifled my instincts and added a clause

	(cond ((assq key a-list) => cdr)
		(else nil))

	Sometimes this worked and sometimes it broke
	I debugged and prayed and even had a stroke
	Many a guru tried valiantly to help
	But undefined datums their efforts did squelch.

	I returneth once more to the great sage of T
	For no way out of the dilemma I could see
	He said it was easy -- more lines must I fill
	with code, for FALSE was no longer NIL.

	(let ((val (assq key a-list)))
		(cond (val (cdr val))
		 (else nil)))

	You'd think by now I might be nearing the end
	Of my ballad which seems bad things to portend
	You'd think that we could all go home scot-free
	But COND eschewed VAL; it wanted #T

	So I went back to the master and appealed once again
	I said, pardon me, but now I'm really insane
	He said, no you're not really going out of your head
	Instead of just VAL, you must use NOT NULL instead

	(let ((val (assq key a-list)))
		(cond ((not (null? val)) (cdr val))
		 (else nil)))

	My song is over and I'm going home to bed
	With this ineffable feeling that I've been misled
	And just in case my point you have missed
	Somehow I preferred (CDR (ASSQ KEY A-LIST))
